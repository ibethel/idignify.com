<div class="box">This article was originally posted on <a href="http://www.mobilisenow.com">MobiliseNow.com</a>. MobiliseNow is a UK based ministry dedicated to mobilizing the body of Christ in the power of God. It was founded by John &amp; Heather Alcock.</div>
</div>
In this article I want to establish some practical principles of intercession. Perhaps some of the greatest issues to address as intercessors are, true unity of spirit and purpose, and what the spirit of religion has done to our thinking. Both of these issues need to be addressed.

<!--more-->

<strong>1st of all the issue of unity</strong>

We have to understand that Jesus ever lives to intercede for the saints Heb7v25 and He came as an intercessor Is59 v16-17. Is it possible He wants to use His body in the ministry of intercession He is now involved in? Of course He does!

So how does He do this?

He said He would send another Comforter, Helper, Advocate , Standby, Strengthener, Counsellor, INTERCESSOR to be with us John 16v7 (Amplified).

The Holy Spirit is the One who directs the prayers God wants prayed on this earth through His people. The Spirit prays with and through those who will yield to Him.

If we read Romans 8v26, the Word says that the Spirit helps us in our weakness (or inability) for we do not know what prayer to pray nor how to pray it worthily.

That word “helps” is the Greek word “sunantilambanomai” which means He takes hold of together with us against. What a wonderful thought, I allow Him to use my body, soul and spirit for His work and I get to ride in the Holy Spirit bulldozer as He comes and pushes mountains out the way. This is a bit like the mouse and elephant, who were friends, and walked across a bridge together. When they got to the other side the mouse looked up at his friend the elephant, and said, “My we really shook that bridge up didn’t we!”

If the Holy Spirit is allowed to work through us like this then Rom 8v28 applies. “We are assured and know that God being a partner in their labour, all things work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to His design and purpose”. Read Colossians 4v12. Paul calls this type of prayer labour. So the labour referred to here, is the labour of praying in partnership with the Holy Spirit. And by involving God in the issues prayed for, there will be a favourable outcome.

Romans 8v27 says, ”The Spirit intercedes and pleads before God on behalf of the Saints in perfect accordance with God’s will.” How does He do this?

The best way He does this, is by inspiring us in our prayer language, and giving us utterance.

1Cor14v14 Says, “If I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit by the Holy Spirit within prays.” (Amplified). This means we bypass our intellect and understanding. This is an act of the highest humility and trust in God. Many people think the Holy Spirit is incapable of doing the job if they do not understand everything that is being prayed.

This causes them not to use their prayer language very much, if at all. Read 1Cor14v18.

Once we have prayed in the Holy Spirit and discerned the mind of Christ we can pray in the understanding. <strong>Paul says to pray first in the Spirit then in the understanding.</strong> How often do we do it that way around?

At Babel God confused the language of the people. This was to scatter them Gen11v7-8. In verse 6 of Genesis 11 God says, “They are one people with one language, this is only the beginning of what they will do and now nothing they have imagined will be impossible for them”. Once the new Covenant was established, God reverses this by giving people languages inspired by the Holy Spirit Acts 2v4. His plan is to unify all things in Christ Eph1v10. We need to note this and yield to this desire of God. <strong>The language of the Holy Spirit unifies! </strong>

<strong>Imagine what is possible to us who believe, when we are unity with God, and with one another!</strong>

As an intercession leader it has being my experience that people can accept what has just being discussed but battle with the practical aspect of it.

If we were to get 20 mature Christians together to decree governmentally into their county school program, some of the possible issues that would arise could be: should the schools be privatised? Should faith schools be allowed? What about parents who want to home school? Should we have a grammar school? Should pupils be bussed in from less privileged areas? What about the carbon footprint?

There is potential here for conflicting prayers and decrees to be made.

Why is this?

<strong>Generally Christians pray from their own perspective, intellect and understanding.</strong>

What would happen if using this same scenario we set some ground rules.

1 God is bigger smarter and wiser than us. Lets find His mind on these matters and say only what He shows us.

2. We want our prayers to be not only accurate, but also presented correctly, so we will allow the Holy Spirit to pray in and through us.

The above two conditions if agreed upon, would create the necessary agreement and will to work in unity in this matter even if some of the people praying had strongly held and opposing views. This would negate the need for “Democracy” and everyone to express their strongly held point of view, which ultimately causes division and fragmentation in the Body of Christ.

So if we can go beyond our personal prayer language into the prayer language of the Holy Spirit (Intercessor) we partner with the Holy Spirit (God) to pray the perfect will of God for that situation. We allow the Holy Spirit to orchestrate and conduct the prayer until the job is done. How do we know when He is satisfied the job is done?

He gives us the title deed to the prayer - that is the peace of God. Phil4 v 7.

<strong>So we are to partner with God in our prayers!</strong>

In childlike trust in Him and not having to work out everything with our limited minds we can do this.

<strong>2</strong><sup><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>nd</strong></span></sup><span style="font-size: medium;"><strong> The issue of religion</strong></span>

We cannot partner with God in prayer fully if we are always sin conscious. Adam and Eve hid from God when they became sin conscious. For hundreds of years Christians have been taught by the spirit of religion, that they are sinners, saved by grace and that the heart of man is desperately wicked. For those outside of Christ this is true, but for Christians it is not.

We have been taught that repentance means wailing and moaning before God about our sin. (Nothing to do with changing our minds by the Word of God!) We have been taught that we have to obey the Ten Commandments and if we are not obedient to these and the “New Testament Commandments” (whatever those are) God won’t bless us.

Let us be done completely with the teachings of religion. Romans 6 v 3 says if we have been baptised into Christ Jesus we were baptised into His death. See verse 6 of Romans 6. That old sinner, rebel, wicked hearted man died in Christ Jesus. See Gal 2v19 and 20. Now read 2Cor5v17 which says if any man be in Christ he is a new creature altogether.

Ephesians 2 v 5 tells us that even when we were dead in our transgression He gave us the very same new life with which He raised Christ from the dead and He gave us joint seating with Him in the heavenly sphere.

So Christian believer you are a new creature alive with the same Life as Jesus has.

<strong>You are not a reconditioned sinner! You are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.</strong>

<strong>God doesn’t look at us and think I know you really did it but in My grace and mercy I have forgiven you, but both you and I know you are really guilty.</strong>

<strong>The Father looks at us and Says “Look at My son, look at My daughter aren’t they great!” </strong>He does this because He reckons the person who did the bad stuff dead, slain in Christ, on the cross (2Cor5v14). We are not that person now. We are a different person in His eyes. We are a brand new person in Christ (2Cor5v17). In other words, in God’s eyes, there is no more sin to even be considered for those in Christ. In Heb 9v26 the Bible tells us sin is abolished (Amplified).

As regards obeying the Law or any system of behaviour. Read Rom7v 4. When we died in Christ we also died to the Law. You see anyone who tries to be righteous by obeying the Ten Commandments (Law) or any other religious requirements, for that matter, is under a curse. Gal 3v10. So if you still desire to be righteous by obeying Law and/or any other rituals you put yourself under a curse. <strong>We the followers of Christ Jesus are not righteous by behaving right, but by believing right!</strong>

<strong>We behave righteously because we ARE righteous.</strong>

<strong>We don’t try to behave righteously to be righteous.</strong>

God wants us to be bold in His presence and to be worthy ambassadors of Christ. He wants to expand His Kingdom and make His manifold wisdom known to the powers and principalities through us His church (Ephesians 3v10). We have to carry ourselves as Sons of God and exercise authority as sons of God and His representatives on this earth.

<strong>Put religion away and rise up Intercessors and Ambassadors of Christ in the boldness and power of God!</strong>

Imagine one of the Ambassadors of Britain crawling through the door of 10 Downing Street, grabbing David Cameron's with his head on the ground and saying, “O David, I am unworthy to stand in your presence! “ David Cameron would replace him immediately, and so he should.

Do not be an ambassador for Christ who behaves like that! That’s pathetic.

<strong>In Conclusion</strong>

We are partners and co-labourers with God. We come to Him boldly. Our prayers are to be God breathed and Spirit prayed. It is His Kingdom, and His perfect will needs to be prayed every time we pray. We can achieve this by praying first in the Spirit and then in the understanding, the order that Paul puts it in 1Cor 14 v13-15.

We have to lay aside our personal agendas and everything we have learned up to now and trust Him to lead us as we pray and intercede in this, the new season we have already entered into.

Blessings!

		<title>The Spirit of Revival</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The spirit of Revival has been released across the globe. On July 23rd 2010 Revival broke out in Mobile Alabama as a woman who was paralyzed for 22 years began to walk. We had the privilege of attending this revival for nearly two months. We saw multiple healings and miracles. We watched as Lady Delia Knox walked and praised God on the platform for her miracle.

Dutch Sheets was speaking one night and declared this Revival a genuine awakening. 10 years before this Revival broke out someone asked  Pastor Yonggi Cho where the last great Revival would break out. He reportedly turned to a globe of the earth and pointed to Mobile Bay, ( named Bay of Holy Spirit by the Spaniards ), and said it would begin here. It indeed has begun.

While attending the conference I had a vision of tsunami wave of the blood of Jesus rolling across the land. Satan was standing there holding a toothpick up, trying to hold back the waves. He of course he  could not. I also saw Revival breaking out in Wyoming. I saw a huge cross at the eastern side of the state overshadowing the entire state, from east to west, with the four corners of the cross touching the four borders of the state. Suddenly the cross spontaneously combusted and smoke poured from the cross. From the east came the wind of His Spirit and it blew the smoke of His presence across the entire state.

I believe that the Spirit of Revival has been released in the earth and that God is looking for someone who actually believes that greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world to rise up and begin to act like it. Every since we left Alabama last December God has had us traveling all over the Northwest releasing Revival where ever we go.  Go God!!!!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>What does Justified mean to a believer in Christ Jesus</title>

<div class="box">This article was originally posted on <a href="http://www.mobilisenow.com">MobiliseNow.com</a>. MobiliseNow is a UK based ministry dedicated to mobilizing the body of Christ in the power of God. It was founded by John &amp; Heather Alcock.</div>
</div>
<strong>What does “Justified” mean to a Believer in Jesus Christ?</strong>

Romans Chap 5v1. <em>Therefore since we are justified (acquitted, declared righteous, and given a right standing with God) through faith, let us grasp the fact that we have the peace of reconciliation to hold and to enjoy peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ the Messiah, the Anointed One. </em>

Strong's translates the word justified;  <em>as to show, exhibit, evince, one to be righteous, such as he is and wishes himself to be considered.</em>

<em>To declare, pronounce, one to be just, righteous, or such as he ought to be.</em>

You Christian believer have been declared righteous (justified) by God the great judge, and given a status of grace and favour with Him.  This is through your faith.

How can God who is a good judge, declare you righteous, not guilty, innocent of your failings and unrighteous acts?

If you went to court and were plainly proven guilty during the course of your trial, the judge would have to impose a sentence that the guidelines of the law required.

If the judge made up his own sentence or said something like, “ I am in a good mood today and I find the defendant really funny so I am acquitting him even though he is guilty and justice demands that he is punished”.  That judge would not be a good judge and would probably be disbarred.

The judge has to weigh up the facts and with his or her expert knowledge of the law, make an appropriate judgement and sentence accordingly.

Now the Great Judge, God, has declared that the wages of sin is death.  So how can He declare now you are innocent?  Many Christians will say, “He has forgiven us through the sacrifice of Jesus on the cross.” Or they will say, “The blood of Jesus has washed my sin away”.  Both these statements are true but they do not carry the full impact of what has caused God to declare us righteous.  We have not been sentenced and our consciences still condemn us.

If that was the total of what has happened, God would still know I did things I wasn’t punished for, I would know I did bad things and be glad He has forgiven me.  And yet, I would still carry the shame and regret and sorrow of my past, and even embarrassment in God’s presence because, “He knows all about me! What I am really like”.

<strong>Let me tell you a parable here to bring some more truth into our problem with our conscience.</strong>

A man brutally assaulted and raped a woman in his home. She laid charges and he was arrested and brought to trial.  The whole town was talking about this case.  The court was packed on the day of sentencing.  The judge had found the man absolutely guilty of the charges.  As he is about to pass sentence the woman victim stands up and says, “Sir, I would like to withdraw all charges.  I have chosen to forgive the man.  He has said he is sorry.”

The judge then bangs down his gavel and says case dismissed, the prisoner is free to go.

Everyone would be talking about how lucky the man was to be free  even though he is such a brute and totally guilty.  He would be shunned.  The man himself would carry the shame and consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.

This is the state of many Christians. They know they are Forgiven, but they are still trapped by the weight of their past.  They carry guilt and shame.  They think there is always someone around them who is a better Christian than they are.

Now lets go back to that courtroom at the time of judgment and consider a different scenario.  As the judge considers the facts, he says, “this man looks the same as the man who did this, he even lives in the same house but he is not the same man.  The man who did this evil deed is in fact dead.  This is not the same man.   You are acquitted of all charges as you are innocent!  You may leave the court."

There would be a surge of approval through the courtroom. Justice has been done.

People would flock around the defendant and tell him how glad they are this is over and that he has been totally exonerated and his name cleared. The judge would be commended for seeing justice has been done and that he has declared the man righteous and innocent of all charges.

The man would know that he is innocent would not carry any guilt or regret into his future.  People in his community would know he was innocent and not talk about him.  He would get on with his life with no shame, guilt or regret.

<strong>Now lets see what this means to you and I the New Testament believer in Jesus Christ.</strong>

All of us were sinners. Gone astray.  Trapped in our sin and iniquities.  Even good people fall short of God’s standard of perfection.

And then by the grace of God and the drawing of the Holy Spirit we come to Christ.  We receive Jesus, believe in our hearts and confess with our mouths  "He is Lord."  We call upon His name and decide to follow Him.

Now lets look at what actually happens legally to allow the Great Judge, our Father, at this point to declare us righteous.

Rom chap 6v3-7. <em> "Are you ignorant of the fact that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into His death?  We were buried with Him by the baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead, so we too might live and behave in newness of life.  For if we have become one with Him by sharing a death like His, we shall also be one with him by sharing His resurrection by a new life lived for God."</em>

<em>We know that our old unrenewed self was nailed to the cross with Him that our body, which is the instrument of sin, might be made ineffective and inactive for evil that we may no longer be slaves of sin. For when a man dies he is freed from the power of sin.  If we have died with Christ we shall also live with him.</em>

Remember the wages of sin is death.  Well God the Great Judge has seen this law obeyed to the full.  We sinned and therefore we died.  How? In Christ Jesus on the cross!

God reckons us to be in Christ Jesus.  1Cor 6v17 tells us that the person who is united to the Lord is one Spirit with Him.  If you join yourself to Christ you are one spirit with Him.

2 Cor 5v14. <em>"The love of Christ compels us that if One died for all, then all died."</em>

Just as in the parable I shared the one who did the crime died and the one who was charged was not that man, but was innocent of all charges, so you are not the person who has done all the bad stuff. That person has been crucified in Christ Jesus on the cross and has died. You live in the same house, your body. You look like that person and even feel like that person but you are not that person. The old you is dead!

Paul says it like this in Galatians 2 v 20. <em>“ I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave Himself up for me”.</em>

The New Testament believer has been crucified in Christ and raised to new life.

He or she is a brand new creature 2Cor 5v17. The old spiritual and moral condition has passed away. Behold the fresh and new has come.

Blessings

John Alcock.

		<title>Why do we dream?</title>

Num 12v6. If there is a prophet among you I, the Lord, make myself known to him in a vision or a dream.

During sleep our reasoning is dormant while our imagination is active. God has our full attention and we cannot control what is happening. If we were awake when we dreamed, we would probably zone out the thoughts or experiences we were having as illogical or meaningless.

Dreams bypass the natural thinking of men and women, saved or unsaved.

<em>1 Cor2V14. The non-spiritual man does not accept into his heart the gifts and teachings and revelations of the Spirit of God, for they are meaningless to him.</em>

This passage is written to born again people.  Consider Heb 5v11-14.  It speaks about the fact that if we feed on milk the whole time or we are lazy in spiritual things we will not grow in our spiritual faculties.  We need to be trained in the things of God.  We need to apply ourselves to the things of God.  2 Peter1v3-9 says a similar thing.

The word of God reshapes the patterns of our thinking.  <em>Rom 12v2 "says be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable will of God.” </em>

Lance Wallenau, an apostle in the Christian International network, uses a good illustration of how our minds work.  He says our thoughts are like marbles and our minds are like clay.  As we grow up, our thoughts, like marbles, keep dropping into our minds, the clay.  The dropping marbles wear grooves in the clay over time.  The grooves get deeper and deeper and patterns of thinking are formed.  The result is we categorise things into each of these grooves and become set in our responses and understanding in different areas.  Each time we receive a thought or an idea we will categorize it into a set pattern of thinking.  We could call this our logic.

Certainly our thinking patterns or grooves shape our lives.  They are a result of our family background, education, worldview (shaped to a large extent by the media), experience, culture, religious teaching.  From these grooves we get our perspective on life, habits, prejudices, values and so on.

Our thoughts will follow preconditioned processes through us and shape our responses and actions in life.

<strong>Why does Jesus tell us to come as little children?  Because these grooves are less established.  Children are more open to new ideas than most adults.</strong>

Now when God drops thoughts from His Spirit into our minds, unless we have exercised our senses to discern His “voice”, these thoughts follow the same paths and patterns of our own thoughts and we might reject them as unimportant or silly because they don’t fit into one of our grooves of thought.  We don’t discern the difference between soul and Spirit.

The answer is to be transformed by the renewing of your mind that, “You may prove what is the good and acceptable will of God.”

<strong>NB</strong> <strong>The voice of God in our mind sounds like our own thoughts most of the time, but it carries a ring that you learn to recognise as you grow in God and in fellowship with Him.  You must train yourself to hear “The still small voice.”  Jesus said, “My sheep know My voice” John 10v4.</strong>

&nbsp;

<strong>So what are we to do?</strong>

Rom 12v2. We need to be transformed by the renewing of our minds.

We need to exercise our spiritual senses. Heb 5 11-14.

We need to learn the language of the Spirit. We are new creatures and have a new language.

Be renewed in the spirit of your mind Eph 4v23

We need to seek, ask, knock, and take our inheritance seriously.

This is why we need a foundation of the words of God so we can divide soul and Spirit.  The idea is we want to have spiritual clay in our head that can be shaped by the Word of God and the thoughts of the Spirit.  In other words become like little children in that we start all over again to shape our thoughts God’s way Rom 12v2.

<strong>In conclusion</strong>

God gives us dreams to bypass any limitations we might have in receiving revelations from Him.  Much of the time He has spoken similar messages to us in other ways which we might not have received.  Such is God's love for us that He wants to communicate a lot with us.  As we search out the meaning of the dream or dreams we have, we draw closer into Him.  Ask the Lord to give you dreams and tell Him you will take them seriously.  Write them down and then search out their meaning with the help of the Holy Spirit.  There will be further instruction on interpretation of dreams and the language of the Spirit in new articles on this site.

In the previous blog in New Creation Realities, we saw that God justifies us because He reckons us to have died in Christ Jesus on the cross.  At Calvary the price was paid in full for all the sin and transgressions of the whole world, past present and future.  It was an act that was outside of time!  As people join themselves to Christ by faith in Him, God reckons them to have died in Christ and He raises them to new life.  Eph 2v5-6.

Not only did we die (in our sin) in Him on the cross, but we also died to the Law and the written decrees that condemned us.  We have no further intercourse with the Law.  Rom 7v4 and v6, Gal 2v19 to 21.

The Law showed us the power sin had over us.  Gal 3v19.  The Law held us captive and showed us our need for the new life and covenant we would receive by being joined to Christ.  Gal 3v23-24.

In this new life we now live in Him we are no longer subject to the Law.  We are free of the Law!  Rom 4v15 tells us,  “Where there is no law there is no transgression of it either.”  This is repeated in Rom 5v13 and again in Rom 7v8.

<strong>Where there is no law sin is dead! </strong>

Can you imagine what would have happened to Adam in the Garden of Eden if he threw a stone at the dog and was nasty to Eve?  Would he have been thrown out of the garden for sinning against God?  What if he had shouted at God?

Nothing would have happened to him if he ever did such things because there was no law against him doing those things.  He broke the only commandment there was.  That was sin!  What if there was no command concerning the fruit in the garden?  Would it have been a sin to eat it?  Of course not!

<strong>Where there is no law there is no transgression! Rom 4v15.</strong>

I see many Christians who think that the slate was wiped clean, and that all their sin was forgiven up to the time they were born again.  They believe that God has now given them a fresh start to keep His Law and obey Him.  To help them do this God has given them the Holy Spirit.  They now need to live holy lives and be righteous or at worst they will lose their salvation, and at best, they will lose their fellowship with God until they sort themselves out and live righteously.  When they fail in keeping the standard of righteousness they think they should keep, or others expect them to keep, they feel like absolute failures and lose all their joy and often just give up.

They believe and have been taught that they need to confess all their sin to God to be kept cleansed and to maintain their righteousness.

This is ludicrous!  How can we set the standards and terms of righteousness?  What happens if there is something we should be doing that we don’t know about?  What happens if God tells us to do something and we don’t hear or understand it, or we do it wrong?

Horror!  What happens if we sinned and didn’t even know?  Or worse forgot to confess one we did yesterday?  These people try to categorise sin into serious sins and not so serious ones.  If you commit adultery that is disgusting! Meanwhile these same people will excuse their unbelief in the power and love of God.  They will worry and be anxious about many things.  They will dismiss their apathy and lack of faith as God’s will.  Their attitude is, “Whatever’s to be will be! If its God’s will it will happen.”

That is rubbish!

<strong>James 2 v10 says that if you break even one tiny part of the law you are guilty of breaking it all.  So maintaining your righteousness by your own efforts is impossible.</strong>

Categorising ”sin” is idolatry. There is only one standard of righteousness acceptable to God and that is perfection.  His righteousness.  Here’s the good news, God gives us His perfect righteousness as a free gift through our faith in Jesus Christ!

<strong><em>We received this gift of perfect righteousness by faith and we keep it by faith not by works!</em></strong>

Lets rejoice we are free of the Law and the penalties it carries.  The salvation God has given us is complete and the righteousness we have received is perfect.  We do not need to do add anything to it.

This freedom is very threatening to religious thinking, which is hostile to it.  Right now people reading this will be thinking, “Well if there’s no law and no penalty for wrongdoing why don’t I go out there and just go mad?”  Do all the sin I want to do and rely on God’s grace that everything will be all right.

That is wrong thinking because it does not take into account what has actually happened to us in our death and new birth in Christ Jesus.

God hasn’t given us a robe of righteousness that just covers us outside, but inside we are still this wicked untrustworthy sin permeated and evil natured person with all kinds of sin trying to get out of us, but we continually restrain ourselves by self-discipline and a huge effort to keep it in so it cannot express itself.

This sin nature is what was killed in us. Rom 6v 6 and Colossians 2v11.

Paul addresses this in Romans 6 v1 to 11. “Are we to remain in sin in order that God’s grace may multiply and overflow?”  No!  We are dead to sin!  Our relation to it is broken!  In verse 11 Paul says we must think like this.  Our relationship with sin is broken.  We are alive to God in Christ Jesus.

Start thinking righteousness.  We are the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus.  Meditate on the fact that you are righteous.  Sin is a spent force that you must no longer give power to by exalting and dwelling on.  Forget the past and lay hold of today and what lies ahead for you in God.  I am convinced that where people battle with sin it is because they are ignorant of what God has done in them and who they are in Christ.  They have allowed sin to appear to them as a giant that controls them.

This is because they judge themselves by some standard of right and wrong. They have put a law of righteousness in place in their lives.  Law is Law!  Whatever you call it!  Galatians 5 v4 says if you seek to be justified through the Law (that is any law of righteousness or accepted behaviour) you have been separated from Christ and have fallen from grace.

<em>So be guided by the Holy Spirit and you are not subject to Law. Gal 5v18.</em>

The righteousness that God has given us is a free gift that is imputed to us.  He has given us His very own nature and life.  The born again believer is not a sinner by nature.  False humility says, “I am just a sinner saved by grace.” This is wrong thinking.  We have new life and a new nature in us.  We are totally new creatures (2 Cor 5v17).  We are walking in the Light as He is in the Light.  We are not under the Law.  Where there is no law there is no transgression.  We are dead to the law and we are alive to righteousness.  We are righteous because we received it as a free gift from God by faith.  We did not earn it and we certainly cannot keep it by our behaviour.  This is why Paul is so severe on the Galatians in Chap 3 v1-5.

<strong>We don’t do righteous things to be righteous!  We do righteous things because we are righteous!</strong>]]></content:encoded>

</div>
If you are born again you are a new creation, a spiritual being, sinless, holy and perfect in Christ.  All the old moral and spiritual condition has passed away.

<em> </em><em>Heb 10v10 “And in accordance with this will of God, we have been made holy (consecrated and sanctified) through the offering made once for all of the body of Jesus Christ (the Anointed One).</em>

<em> Heb 10v12-14 “Whereas this one (Christ), after He had offered a single sacrifice for our sin (that shall avail) for all time, sat down at the right hand of God. </em><em>Then to wait until His enemies should be made a stool beneath His feet. </em><em>For by a single offering He has forever completely cleansed and perfected those who are consecrated and made holy”. </em>

You must grasp this. You are in HIM!  (<em>If any man be in Christ he is a new creature</em> 2 Cor5v17).  This means you are joined to Him. 1 Cor6v17.  You are one spirit with Him.  He is in you. John 17v23.  He is in the Father. John17v21.  The Father is in HIM.  The Father is in you.  That means He and the Father are in you and you are in Them.  His Spirit is in you.

<em> </em><em>Colossians 2v9-10 “For in Him the whole fullness of Deity (the Godhead) continues to dwell in bodily form (giving complete expression of the divine nature). And you are in Him made full and having come to fullness of life (<strong>in Christ you too are filled with the Godhead- Father, Son and Holy Spirit- </strong>and reach full spiritual stature).  And He is the Head of all rule and authority (of every angelic principality and power).</em>

Now how can sin operate in our unity with Him?  Does Jesus sin?  Does God sin?  Never!  Is part of Jesus sinful?  Absolutely not!  But you are part of Him!  Joined to Him!  If you see yourself as sinful, do you now see sin in Him who is perfect?  Of course you don’t!  This will challenge what a lot of people have been taught but you have to go with what the word of God says.  There is no sin in Jesus Christ.  He is perfect even with us in Him. That means we are perfect and holy as  Heb 10v12-14 quoted above says.

<em>The person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him 1 Cor6v17.</em>

<strong>We can be joined to Him because we are the same as Him. </strong>

<em>Eph 2v5</em> “<em>Even when we were dead (slain) by our own shortcomings and trespasses, He made us alive together in fellowship and in union with Christ; (<strong>He gave us the very life of Christ Himself, the same new life with which He quickened Him</strong> for) it is by grace (His favour and mercy which you did not deserve) that you are saved (delivered from judgement and made partakers of Christ’s salvation). </em>

We are new creatures with new life.  The life that was given to us at our rebirth is the same new life that exploded in Jesus Christ when He rose from the dead.  In Him we have been made perfect, holy and righteous.  This is why we can be joined to Him without bringing sin into the Godhead.

Sin is abolished (Heb9v26 Amplified Bible) or as other translations say “put away with”.  Read Hebrews 9 verses 24 to 28 in different translations and the Amplified bible.  The law and the decrees that condemned us, because we broke them continually, were nailed to the cross.

<em>Colos 2v13-14  And you who were dead in trespasses and in the uncircumcision of your flesh (your your sensuality, your sinful carnal nature), God brought to life together with Christ, having freely forgiven us all our transgressions. Having cancelled and blotted out and wiped away the handwriting of the note (bond) with its legal decrees and demands which was in force and stood against us (hostile to us). This (note with its regulations, decrees and demands) He set aside and cleared completely out of our way by nailing it to (His ) cross. </em>

If your bank manager tells you someone paid off your loan and tears up the loan agreement you have with him saying this loan is cleared completely, are you still obligated to make payments or to keep the conditions of the agreement? You would be silly if you did!  Your obligations to the terms and conditions of that agreement are over.

We were guilty and we died in Christ Jesus. God reckoned us joined to Him and in Him on the cross.  The sacrifice of Jesus on the cross to pay for the sins of the whole world was an eternal act outside of time.  A once and for always act.  It removed the sin of the world past, present and future for all time.  The price was paid in full.  That obligation and barrier which stood between God and us is removed eternally.

God sees us through the completed work of the cross at Calvary.  If we are born again He sees us all as totally new creatures, born of God, sons in His household!

<strong><em>2 Cor5v16 says, “Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh.”</em></strong>

That includes how we regard ourselves!   We are to see ourselves as He sees us!  You are not a failure or a misfit.  Your Heavenly Father loves you and accepts you completely.  He sees you as spirit.  You are spirit.  What is born of the Spirit is spirit. (John 3v6.)  You have a soul (will intellect emotions) and you live in a body but you are a spirit being.

Recently I was driving a group to a church where we were going to minister.  A lady in the car with us was talking about the state of the church and asking how Jesus could come back for a perfect bride without spot or blemish. She was saying that manipulation, gossip, control, divorce, adultery, idolatry, false doctrine and all kinds of are stuff going on.  My reply was, “No!  The Church is perfect and holy!  She’s the righteousness of God in Christ Jesus and she’s the delight of the Father and the Son.  He loves her as much as He loves Jesus. (John 17 v3.)”  Don't judge according to the flesh.    (I will deal with how we are to live and conduct ourselves in Christ in the next Blog).

We have been circumcised.  The sin nature removed from us.  As our minds are renewed, our will, emotions and feelings will be transformed.  It takes time.  We went on a barge trip for a week.  I could still feel the rocking motion for days after we got back home.  My mind knew I wasn’t on the water but my feelings were telling me I was.  My feelings followed my mind a couple of days later.  The rocking sensations ceased.

Do not be governed by your feelings. Don’t let them bring condemnation on you. As you meditate on who you are in Christ they will fall in line with the word.

<em>But you are a chosen race a royal priesthood a dedicated nation, God’s own purchased special people, that you may set forth the wonderful deeds and display the virtues and perfections of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light. 1 Peter 2v9.</em><em> </em>

The church has to see herself as Jesus sees her to do the works of Jesus today.  He was and is the exact representation of the Father.  How can we represent the Father if we are continually,  in error,  seeing ourselves as weak, struggling with sin, defeated and consequently powerless?  We don't need to hold onto Jesus’ feet with all our strength and continually ask for mercy?  Hey!  We are free!  Sin is abolished, done away with, put aside eternally.  The blood of Jesus which purchased us speaks over us and we have free access to His throne by that blood.

Let us rise up and be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might without any fear or shame.]]></content:encoded>

  What can you add to the cross ?!!!! What can you add to the finished work of His shed blood who once and for all eradicated and destroyed the handwriting on the wall? The spirit of performance must be squashed in our lives. It was not by works that you were saved and it is not by works that you can receive anything else from Daddy. 
  You can stand before both God and satan and declare with all good conscience, " you have found nothing in me", I am just as clean and whole and holy as Jesus. Thanks be to God for His mighty blood.]]></wp:comment_content>

</div>
Recently at a healing activation workshop in Evesham we looked at how hardness of heart and unbelief stop us moving in the power of God and doing miracles. Paul tells us in 2Cor4v18 to look not to what is seen but to what is unseen. This is looking into the eternal realm. This realm is of higher authority than the natural realm. It supercedes the natural realm.

We connect to the natural realm through our senses and feelings. Things that anchor us to the natural realm are our educations (both religious and secular), our traditions, our habits, our experiences, our failures or successes, our natural wisdom, the media, the culture around us, our families, our friends and the environments we live in to name a few. Yet Paul says look not to the natural or Seen things but look to the Eternal things for they are unchanging, unlike seen things.

We did an interesting excercise which I would recommend you dear reader do.  I drew a horizontal line in the middle of a whiteboard. Above the line we labelled the eternal or higher realm, underneath we labelled the seen or natural realm. We then listed all the benefits we have In Christ in the heavenly realm as per Eph 1v3 above the line,  and what we have in the natural realm underneath that line. It soon became obvious where we need to focus and draw our comfort and strength and vision from.  The Kingdom of God manifests around us when we live from the higher eternal realm, the place of being seated in Christ in the heavenly (eternal) realm, and allow that to manifest through our lives into the natural realm. We must live not moved by what we see or hear or feel in the natural realm, but by what we see and hear and are moved by in the eternal realm.

How do we stay in this place of being seated in Christ in the heavenly realm in the midst of all the day to day pressures and demands that are being made on us?

I think Psa 103 is an amazing example of how to do this. Praise the Lord and meditate on all His goodness and kindness to us. David meditates in the Word and stirs and remembers himself into a place of excitement before the Lord. He remembers all the blessings God pours out on him. Last but not least Pray in tongues plenty.

There is a teaching on avoiding hardness of heart and unbelief in our "Media" section under MP3 teachings.

I have had a lot of feedback from people as to how this teaching  has helped them.

God Bless,

John.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Revival in Laramie Wyoming</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night in Laramie Wyoming God showed up in a very powerful way at Laramie Christain Center. His presence was overwhelming and very heavy. He gave a word to those in attendance that He had given Laramie to them, but asked, "will you take it"?

It reminded me of when God took Israel into the promised land. One of the first cities they had to conquer was Jericho. Jericho was a military fortified city and even though God had already said to them, I have given you the city, they still had to do their part and go in and take it.

His holy fire fell in upon nearly all who were at the meeting last night and it was both exciting and very sobering. God also said that He was going to shake up the University of Wyoming, the college here in town. In response to His word about taking Laramie, we are going to lead and outreach into the city this afternoon, going out and fulfilling the great commission, to love on the people. Please pray for us and the city of Laramie.

While attending the Bay of Holy Spirit Revival in Mobile Alabama last year the Lord gave me a vision. In this Vision I saw a giant cross at the east border of Wyoming who's shadow touched the 4 borders of Wyoming. Suddenly the cross burst into flames and the wind of the Spirit blew in from the east and blew God's holy presence, ( the smoke ), all over Wyoming. Revival has indeed come to Wyoming. God is looking for a few who will use their faith to pull it down and walk in it. Will you be one of them?]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[Two years ago God gave a Word of Prophecy to us in Cheyenne WY that He was going to bring revival throughout America.  This fire of revival would begin in Alabama, the first state listed alphabetically, and also in Wyoming, the last state alphabetically listed.  As the fire of His Holiness and Presence burned from these two states outward beyond their borders, revival would be spread from the first and the last states to touch every state of this country with His Holiness and Fire.  
What you have shared is an encouragement to all of us in Wyoming to believe that He will bring His Word to pass and that we will experience a true revival of Holiness and Fire not only in our state but also in our nation!]]></wp:comment_content>

		<title>Miracles Break Out in Laramie</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last night was over the top at the Laramie Christain Center. Once again Daddy showed up in a big way and proved His love. The night before Daddy said He had given Laramie to the body of Christ and asked, " will you take it"?

Last night He reiterated, " will you take it"?, I really have released Revival to this city, but you must go in and take it! Holy Spirit came in a very precious way and touched many who were in attendance. Many were healed and one young man went through a major deliverance, who stated, " I felt this huge root come out of my back"!

A woman who had been battling fibromyalgia for over 20 years was healed. She was in much pain, and after standing in the presence of God for 15 or so minutes, was completely healed and walked away with no pain. Another young woman who had a back fracture was completely healed and begin to cry. When asked what was going on she stated " I can't make it hurt"! Then another young woman who was standing in His presence, who stated earlier, " I feel my muscles strengthening", suddenly said, yes, " I can't make it hurt either". Her spine was seriously out of position and she was seeing a chiropractor.

We will be posting some actual testimonies soon, written just as the person who wrote them out did, word for word.

Glory to God!!! His holy fire came and touched people as they sat in their seats.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Wow!! our meetings in Sheridan continued with His Holy Fire falling on most who attended. I am amazed at Daddy's goodness and love for His children. Once again people were healed as they sat in their seats. Many were filled with the Holy Spirit and Holy laughter broke out after one meeting.

The pastor gave birth to spiritual twins as he recieved a word about birthing in not one, but two babies. Some recieved a major deliverance and many were emotionally healed as His love fell. The Lord challenged us to get off the milk, and learn to eat His meat, to walk in His fullness as mature sons and daughters of God, into the abundant life of walking in the Spirit.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://greaterworkshealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pk2050scheme11.gif"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-714" title="Chemical Compound" src="http://greaterworkshealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/pk2050scheme11.gif" alt="Chemical Compound" width="242" height="259" /></a>In 1920 John G. Lake wrote an article title "The Science of Divine Healing".  In the article he made a fascinating statement: "It was not sufficient to know that God healed; I had to know <em>how </em>God healed."  Lately, as I've been mediating on the subject of faith, I've found myself making similar statements to Lake's.  I want to know what faith is and how it works.  If I were take a scientific approach to the study of faith, what might I discover?  Hebrews 11:1 describes faith as a substance.
<blockquote>"Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen."</blockquote>
So what if faith actually is a substance, matter of definite chemical composition?  The greek word used in this verse for the word substance is hypostasis and does not seem to insinuate the definition of substance that I am, but let's just ask "What if?"  Let's just roll with it and see what we discover.  Let's focus on the idea that faith is a <em>substance</em>.

We must first understand that every substance has a unique set of properties that allow us to differentiate between them. These properties are classified as physical properties and chemical properties. Physical properties are those that can be determined or measured without changing the composition or identity of the substance. Chemical properties tell us how the substance interacts with other substances.  We will now apply these definitions and see what we can discover about the substance of faith.
<h3>Physical Properties</h3>
Faith is mentioned in the bible 248 times (NIV).  Only 9 of these instances are in the Old Testament.  That means the word faith is mentioned 239 times in the New Testament.  39 of those times are within the four gospels with direct relation to Jesus.  Just from those 39 instances we can determine several physical properties of faith:
<ul>
	<li>Anyone can have faith, even the unsaved.</li>
	<li>Faith is something an individual possesses and each persons faith is different then another, just like eye color, height, etc.</li>
	<li>A persons faith can be used to heal themselves or other peoples, as with the case of the Centurion.  His faith healed his servant.</li>
	<li>Some people have more/different faith the others.</li>
	<li>The absence of faith hinders miracles.</li>
	<li>Faith enables a person to defy the laws of nature, as in the case of Jesus and Peter walking on water.</li>
	<li>Some people have great faith while others have little faith.</li>
	<li>Faith can kill or uproot trees and move mountains.</li>
	<li>Fear, doubt and faith do not co-habitat very well.</li>
	<li>Worry is a symptom of a lack of faith.</li>
	<li>Faith can be increased.</li>
	<li>Faith can fail in the sense that we can fail faith (does that make sense?).</li>
	<li>A person can be full of faith.</li>
</ul>
Another interesting physical property of faith is that it only seems to be activated in the presence of Jesus, whether while he was physically on earth or now as he dwells in his people.
<h3>Chemical Properties</h3>
Remember, chemical properties tell us how the substance interacts with other substances.  Based on scripture, testimonies and personal experiences we can determine the chemical properties of faith.  The other substance we will look out here is our bodies.  Here are a few:
<ul>
	<li>Defective and blind eyes are restored.</li>
	<li>Paralyzed persons immediately get up and walk.</li>
	<li>Stopped hearts are restarted (dead are raised).</li>
	<li>Internal bleeding is stopped.</li>
	<li>Skin ravaged by leprosy is regenerated.</li>
	<li>Tumors are dissolved.</li>
	<li>Ear drums are reconstructed.</li>
	<li>Diseased lungs are made new.</li>
	<li>Surgical screws, pins and plates are dissolved within the body.</li>
	<li>Crooked backs are straightened.</li>
	<li>Down syndrome is healed.</li>
</ul>
In some cases the substance of faith creates new cells and tissue.  In other cases, the substance of faith seems to dissolve and kill cells and objects that are foreign to our bodies.  We could say that things that are suppose to be (according to the divine blueprints of our physical bodies) are created, while things that are not in the blueprints are removed.
<h3>Other thoughts</h3>
Is faith a substance we secrete much like the oils in our hands?  Do we leave a residue on the things we touch?  Is this why Jesus said that we'll lay hands on the sick and they will recover?  If it is indeed something we secrete, evidence would suggest that this function can be both voluntary and involuntary (subject for another article).  Perhaps it is this residue of faith that causes the chemical reactions with flesh.
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-721" title="faith" src="http://greaterworkshealing.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/faith.jpg" alt="faith" width="178" height="199" />Faith is something that is very hard to study in a science lab.  From what we can tell it is something that exists mainly in the unphysical realm, but affects the physical realm much like frequencies we cannot hear affect frequencies we do.  Presently we do not have the technology to  examine the substance of faith in more precise and objective  fashion, but perhaps someday that will be a possibility.  There have been some experiments conducted with John G. Lake at a university in Spokane.  In one experiment the doctors put deadly diseases in the palm of his hand and they died on contact...a result that baffled the team of doctors.  So what if?  What if faith is added to the periodic table of elements?  What if we discover it has an electron configuration or density?  I'm just saying, "What if?".

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I would like to talk to you today about the active role of faith in securing the promises of God. The Word says that
<blockquote>“…without faith, it is impossible to please and be satisfactory to Him. For whoever would come near to God must (necessarily) believe that God exists and that He is the rewarder of those who earnestly and diligently seek Him out.”

Hebrews 11:6 (Amp.)</blockquote>
I think that there is a lot of stigma and condemnation over the use of faith, and many are afraid to address the church’s lack of faith head on, because it can lead to guilt and shame. Please hear my heart on this subject: my desire is not to put anyone into bondage, but to bring truth that will set us free to be who God created us to be. Faith is a sensitive subject because every one of us has been challenged when we do not receive what we have asked for. Is it due to lack of faith or is it that we just need to press through until we receive our victory? Is it due to another reason, perhaps sin or an ungodly mindset that we don’t even know we have? These are real issues that we must explore in love.

I never want to get into questioning anyone’s personal faith, but the fact remains that we in the Body of Christ do not receive many of Daddy’s promises due to lack of faith on our part. First of all, I want to say that we are all in various stages in our walk with God, walking in various levels of maturity and faith as we pursue our relationship with Him. I think we should honestly realize where we are at, without feeling any sort of condemnation for it. After all, we do not attempt to put guilt and shame on a baby for trying to crawl or attempting to walk. It is a normal process in our natural life to grow in our bodies until we are fully mature.

In the same way we are in various stages of faith and maturity in our spiritual growth. The enemy tries very hard to challenge our faith level because he knows if we take the bait we will be defeated and receive nothing. That is what the enemy attempted to do with Jesus while He was in the wilderness (Luke 4). Jesus never took the bait but stood strong in the Word of God. He knew who He was. None of us are walking in all the available faith that there is, but we can continue to do the things that will help us continue to grow and mature until we fly, as the sons of God.

I think it is more important to look at where we are at, individually and corporately, and to admit that we fall short, ask God for His grace, and learn how we can walk in an ever-increasing faith and power to overcome ALL the works of the devil. I find it interesting that one minute Jesus seems to be congratulating Peter that he has the revelation of who Jesus is (Matthew 16:17), and in the next minute He is rebuking Peter for thinking like a man, saying, “Get behind Me, satan!” (Matthew 16:23).

We cannot ignore the truth that Jesus challenged the faith of the disciples (Matthew 8:26), and taught them to walk in faith (Mark 11:22-26). He mentioned many times that it was the person’s faith that healed them (Matthew 9:20-22; 9:27-38), and marveled at the centurion’s faith (Matthew 8:5-13), and even seemed to change his mind with the Canaanite woman (Matthew 15:22-28), saying, “Great is your faith!” So how do we increase our faith?

I think the key in receiving everything from the Lord that we need to walk in complete victory as overcomers, comes from spending intimate time with Him. I feel the number one reason we do not walk in faith is our lack of intimacy with our God. There seems to be a great identity crisis in the church. We don’t really know who we are as true sons and daughters of the living God. I see this issue wherever we go. We have so many ungodly mindsets due to a myriad of hurts and wounds throughout life that they veil us from seeing who we really are. We can quote the scriptures, but the Word is not a reality in our hearts. This is directly related to our level of maturity in faith.

True maturity, faith, and peace can come only to those who are in active fellowship with God. There are no shortcuts and faith cannot be mustered up through our will because it is spiritual. It is time for the Body of Christ to begin to “walk by faith, by walking in the Spirit.” Romans chapter 8 teaches clearly that to walk in victory we must walk in the Spirit at all times. For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God (Romans 8:14). I believe with all my heart that when you begin to see who you really are, as a result of spending intimate time with God, you will never again question God’s love for you, and your faith will grow, knowing with all certainty that God is not a man that He should lie, and that He will do what He said He would do. He can be trusted.

It is time for a great paradigm shift in our mindsets. We must begin to walk in the Spirit at all times in all things. I love the Amplified Bible because it expounds on the original Greek and Hebrew meanings of the original scriptures. Romans 8:6 says, “Now the mind of the flesh, [which is sense and reason], without the Holy Spirit, is death, death that comprises all the miseries arising from sin, both here and hereafter. But the mind of the Holy Spirit is life and soul peace, both now and forever. The majority of the church thinks with (sense and reason) when they are in trouble. We put more faith in doctors, banks, governments and scientists than we do in the Word of God. We think and act with the natural way of thinking, which is ok, but there is a much better and higher way, that is perfect. It is like living on the wrong side of the Jordan. Instead of the best, living in the promised land, we choose to stay and live on the other side of the river, in sense and reason land.

The Lord recently showed me another revelation of His statement to Peter in the garden of Gethsemane when He stated, “For all who draw or live by the sword, will die by the sword (Matthew 26:52). In Psalm 118:9, it says it is better to put your trust in the Lord than to put confidence in princes. Psalm 20:7 says, “Some trust in and boast of chariots and some of horses, but we will trust in and boast of the name of the Lord our God.” He showed me that those who put their faith and trust in earthly ways, and in earthly ways of doing business, those who live by the world’s way, the natural way, will die by the world’s way, the natural way. Saints of God, there is the kingdom of this world and there is the Kingdom of God, and they are in direct opposition to one another. The laws of the Kingdom of God are not the same as our natural earthly laws, for they are Spirit and they are Life. Only in the Kingdom of God, when we die, we can truly live.

Matthew 6:33 says, “But seek, aim at and strive after, first of all His Kingdom and His righteousness, His way of doing and being right, and then all these things taken together will be given you besides.” If you back up to Matthew 6:21, Jesus declares that, “For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.” Beginning in Matthew 6:24, we have Jesus teaching his disciples to “not be anxious nor worry about your life, what you will eat or drink,” etc., and rebuking them for their lack of faith. What do we spend the majority of our life doing? Where do we spend the most of our time? Where is our treasure? Is it in His Kingdom or in the natural world?

Again, no condemnation here. My heart is to see the Body grow up and manifest Gods pure love to the lost and dying world, rising up in a faith, that says, all things are possible with our God!!! When we seek His face with all of our heart, we will find Him. We will reflect His love, His heart and His power and out of that direct relationship we will grow to become just like Jesus in every way. All things are possible to those who believe (Mark 9:23). So please, let us not cast away our confidence (Hebrews 10:35). Seek Him with all of our hearts, and we will find Him. Then go!! Pray for as many as you can, using the gifts Daddy has given you.

2nd Timothy 1:6 tells us to stir up the gifts, activate them in your life, by using them. Timothy received the gift from Paul by the laying on of hands. Then Paul instructed him to stir them up. If it came from the laying on of hands it must be a gift from the Holy Ghost.

We are told to desire earnestly the best gifts. 1st Corinthians 12:31 says “…but earnestly desire and zealously cultivate the greatest and best gifts…”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[You must begin to ask yourself, what does a real man or woman of God look like? What do they do? God is shaking everything that can be shaken, and that includes anything and everything that we hold our security in, other than the cross of Christ. We simply must die to self, pick up our cross, each and every day, and follow Christ. In this hour, we must learn to walk in the Spirit, or else we will simply not survive what is coming. Dependency on jobs, money, bank accounts, IRA’s, governments, homes, family, or anything else other than the finished work of the cross will not do in this hour. In fact dependency on anything else but the cross is idolatry.

The reason that most of the Body of Christ is sick, is in fear, is lacking, and has no peace, is simply because we have trusted in things other than the cross. This is not to say that some of us are not battling through these issues boldly, by depending on the cross, but many do not know how to battle through properly. Many are still depending on the arm of the flesh, which will always fail. We have so many promises in His Word, and God is not a man that He should lie, and yet so many are falling so very short of what is available to us.

I myself have not arrived, and must continue to rise up beyond the daily challenges of being a Pastor, a Director and a Preacher, as well as a fellow Christian. I will be held accountable to God if I do not challenge you to rise up this coming year and lay hold of your destiny. Anything less just will not do in this hour. I hope you see my heart in this.

Our hearts are to equip the Body to do the works of the ministry. What are the works? We need not look any further than Jesus, who perfectly represented the Father in every way. We are to heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers (incurable diseases) and cast out demons. That was how Jesus perfectly showed Daddy’s love. I do understand that all of us are in various stages of maturity in our walk with God and that some of us are just not there yet -- totally acceptable -- so no condemnation here.

It is all about hunger. Are you so hungry for God, that nothing less than personal, corporate, national and international revival will do? If you aren’t, check yourself and get before God and seek His face and ask for the grace you need to be all that He desires you to be.

Daddy wants us to eat meat and get off the milk. In doing so, we must never trust in anything but the finished work of the cross to overcome the sin nature that we try so very hard to deal with through ourselves, attempting to change ourselves through fruitless, external means that are doomed to failure. You cannot change yourself, and grace is not automatic. The Holy Spirit can only give out grace as we depend solely on the cross in faith. This releases Him to give us the grace we all need. It was by grace that we were saved so why do we think anything else will change us? Without faith it is IMPOSSIBLE to please God. Humbling ourselves before Daddy in faith in the already finished work of the cross is what releases the Hand of God to change us from the inside out. Nothing else can nor will.

May we rise up together, as a true church of God, not just existing, not just going to church, but rather being the Church, His beautiful Bride, together in true fellowship in this coming year.]]></content:encoded>

			<wp:comment_content><![CDATA[OH, its so our hearts to rise up above status quo Christianity. Powerless Christianity will not change peoples lives, let alone change the culture of nations to Kingdom Culture. How else are we to demonstrate Daddy's love to a lost, poor, blind, naked and needy world, if we do not demonstrate it like Jesus did, in absolute unfettered power. Power that breaks the chains of every type of bondage and eradicates every type of disease, even destroying and overcoming literal death. 
  An angel came to John G. Lake and said to him, " this is Pentecost as God gave it through the heart of Jesus. Strive for this, contend for this, Teach the people to pray for this. For this ALONE, ( emphasis mine ), will meet the necessity of the human heart and have the power to overcome the forces of darkness. What was this angel saying? He was declaring, that Pentecost, ( being truly baptized in Holy Spirit), and this alone, will destroy all bondage in the human heart, and overcome the dark veil over peoples minds, wills and emotions, in and out of the church. Only this power will heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, ( incurable diseases ), cast out demons, heal the broken hearted, open blind eyes, open deaf ears, release the captives, deliver the oppressed, bruised, crushed and broken down. Our God reigns! Mark Kuntz]]></wp:comment_content>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[It is so true: not realizing how much God wants to pour Himself out on us makes us miss out on so much. The primary weapon of the enemy is deceit by way of inferiority. Until we can see who we really are, we are only limited by what we think we are, hence, as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. The enemy's tactics always attack our identity and cause us to get into doubt and fear, which hold us back from going for everything God has for us. That is why I wanted everyone to read the book [<em><a title="The Unquenchable Flame" href="http://www.amazon.com/Unquenchable-Flame-Revival-Never-Burns/dp/0768431042" target="_blank">The Unquenchable Flame: Revival That Never Burns Out</a></em> by Sandy Davis Kirk] because I believe it puts our priorities in their rightful place and helps us to see His great love for us. How can one look deeply into the cross and not see anything but love and grace? The key to walking in victory is to always see yourself in a place of victory that was already purchased for us on the cross. We should never battle from a place of defeat; that's one of our biggest mistakes. We should only battle from a place of victory, focusing on the answer, Jesus, and not on the problem.

<strong>Renewing the Mind</strong>
<blockquote>James 4:7 tells us to submit to God; resist the devil and he will flee.

2nd Corinthians 10:4 says that the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty...

2nd Corinthians 10:5 continues with: Cast down every vain imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of God...

Philippians 4:6-10 encourages us to be anxious for nothing, do not worry, but by prayer and supplication make your requests made known to God... and to ...meditate on these things...</blockquote>
Anytime we allow ourselves to get out of peace we are not submitting our minds to Christ. As long as we allow the enemy to keep us on a plane of feelings and emotions, we will be defeated. We must keep our minds renewed actively every single day, on purpose (Romans 12:2). Keeping our minds renewed has to do with what thoughts we allow, or meditate on each day. We are always thinking, thoughts are always coming in. They are either your own, the devil's, or God's. We are always meditating anyway but the key is to keep your eyes fixed on Jesus and His Word (Hebrews 4:12). We do not focus on problems, only the solution, which is Christ.

So anytime an ungodly thought comes in, anytime a thought that is contrary to His Word comes in, we do what Jesus did in Luke 4. The devil tried to get Jesus on the plane, or realm, of reason, or the natural, the same way he did in the garden of Eden. Did God truly say...? He tried to plant doubt. If you really are the Son of God... Jesus never argued or shouted or allowed His mind to meditate on those thoughts; He immediately said, "It is written..." He used the Word of God as a weapon. One of our biggest mistakes is that we try to battle the enemy from our own reasoning and from our soul man. We do not first submit ourselves to God before we begin to try to resist the devil. We will never win that battle. We must first submit to God before we resist the devil. Then we will get the same results that Jesus did, for the bible says that the devil left for a more opportune time.

After we have submitted our thoughts, feelings and emotions to God, we can then resist the devil effectively by using the weapons of our warfare, which are not carnal. They are not earthly weapons, not natural weapons, but powerful, heavenly weapons. Pull out those weapons, put on that armor (Ephesians 6:13-18). Then we can begin to cast down all of those vain reasonings, vain imaginations that attempt to exalt themselves, that rage against God.

Then we pray and do not worry, do not doubt. James 1:6 says ...and the peace that passes all understanding will come upon us. We meditate on, focus on, these things, His Word, whatever is lovely and pure etc. This is how we guard our hearts with all due diligence and change our natural thinking into Kingdom thinking.

Let us cross over into the promised land instead of living so far below what God has already given us. Let us come out of the natural way of living our lives and live only in the supernatural. Let us change -- as a man thinketh in his heart, so he is -- from living in defeat to living in victory. You are today the exact product of your thought life yesterday. Change your thoughts, change your life.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Last year I sent out a message that began with William Branham's teaching on the mind and ended up with mine. I have realized more and more over the years that one of the primary strongholds in our lives has to do with how we think, and what we think about ourselves, others and our relationship with God. Proverbs says that as a man thinks in his heart, so he is. That is why Proverbs also says to guard your heart with all due diligence. The mind or thought life is the gateway or governor into the heart. If a thought can enter into the mind and get past the mind into the heart, it is there that it will turn into an ungodly mindset. An ungodly mindset is any thought that is rooted in the heart that does not agree with scripture. We all have them.

These ungodly mindsets are developed over time through our everyday life experiences. It is when we begin to believe our experiences more than we believe in His Word, that  a mindset is developed. If this is allowed to take root it will generally manifest in other different ways. Remember that an ungodly mindset is called sin and we all know the consequences of sin on our overall health, peace and well being. If you are not living in peace, or experiencing the abundant life that is available to you, you probably are believing a lie of an ungodly mindset about someone, yourself, or God.

For example, I talked to someone the other day, a Christian, who said that they did not believe that God wanted to heal everyone. This thought is pervasive in the modern church today. I asked her why she felt that way. She stated that she knew a pastor, a real man of God, a man of faith who was loved by all. He had an illness  and really believed that he would be healed. Many faith filled people were praying for him and right up to the end he believed he would be healed, but he died. How many of us here have had similar experiences? How many have had faith challenges and try as you may, you feel like you fell short or what you were believing for didn't come to pass as you expected? I know I have.

Many are the afflictions of the righteous but God will deliver us from them all. By His stripes we are healed. These signs will follow those that believe: they will lay hands on the sick and they will recover. If any among you are sick, call for the elders of the church, they will anoint you with oil and the prayer of faith will save or heal you. I am the Lord who heals you. I pray above all things that you prosper and be in good health as your soul prospers. On and on are the scriptures that release to us the promises of God. They are available to us and our God withholds no good thing from those that love Him. So why do we have such a struggle in believing these things? Why have we not experienced more of these promises in our lives? Because simply put, we do not consistently believe in them. Many say its hard to believe after experiencing such disappointments. I do understand that but we must not allow experiences and emotions to rule our lives and carry more power than His Word. As long as the enemy can keep you on the plane of emotions, he will always be able to control you. Jesus said His yoke was easy and His burden light. So even when we buy into how hard it is to live by faith, we have taken the bait.

So how do we get victory over our thought life? We learn to meditate, to think, on God's truths. All of us meditate all the time. We are always thinking on something. I have found that a person who does not walk in peace is allowing their mind to go round and round like a broken record, thinking primarily about their circumstances in life and on negative things. It is not even on a conscious level. We have programmed ourselves that way. So what can we do to reprogram what we meditate on from one thought to another? I will show you some very simple, yet very powerful ways to do this. I want you to remember one thing from now on: (change your thought, change your life). This will be impossible for you to do if you attempt to do it in your own strength. We need the grace of God to receive this and to carry it out; and He gives grace to the humble. I tell you, brothers and sisters, if we will prayerfully read and study this book about the cross, learn to take a deep look into the cross, ourselves, and our problems, then all sickness, all sin, all self, will just fade away. Within the cross lies the answers to all of our issues, every single one of them. That is why we must keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and not on the problems.
<ul>
	<li>Submit to God. James 4:7</li>
	<li>Resist the devil. James 4:7</li>
	<li>Cast down every vain imagination. 2nd Corinthians 10:5</li>
	<li>Replace imagination with truth. Philippians 4:6-9</li>
</ul>
Let us ask God for the grace to receive the revelation of what it really means to submit to Him. In order to submit to God we must know what that means. Picking up your cross daily, laying down your life daily, is when your will meets God's will. Many times we skip past step one and attempt to resist the devil on our own soulish strength. That is a recipe for disaster. Father, give each one of us the grace to submit our thoughts to you. When any thought enters in that is evil, contrary, or does not line up with Your Word, please show it to us clearly, and grace us with the ability to first submit that thought to You.

Father, after we have submitted our minds totally over to Your will, submitting to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, we ask You to give us Your strength, Your anointing, Your power by Holy Spirit, to resist the devil on every front. Help us to be like Jesus in Luke 4:1-14 who did not entertain any thought that the devil threw at Him, did not try to argue or defend, but only declared, it is written, it is written, it is written, and Satan left (fled).

Father help us to recognize whenever a vain imagination, (an ungodly thought, reasoning, theory, argument), attempts to take root in our heart, and grace us with Your power to defeat it. Help us to instantly recognize this deception and to cast it down to the pit immediately. 2nd Corinthians 10:6. Help us, Father, to refute all arguments, theories and reasonings and every other proud and lofty thing that sets itself up against the knowledge of God. Grace us to be able to take those thoughts captive, to capture them and to cast them into the fiery pit, making them submit and be obedient to Christ.

Father, help us to think and to meditate (chew on) You. Help us to keep our eyes fixed on Jesus and to think on these things: (whatever is true, tranquil, holy, worthy, honorable, just, seemly, pure, lovely and lovable). Father grace us with the ability to not fret or have anxiety about anything, but to first come to You with everything, in true humility, in true prayer and petition, and especially thanksgiving, which helps us to enter into Your courts of praise, into Your presence. Father we ask for that peace, that peace that surpasses all understanding, that surpasses our circumstances, our pain, our anxiety, our life. Thank you Father for this peace that you offer us today. Philippians 4:6-9. Thank you for helping us to replace these vain thoughts with Your Word and Your God thoughts. Thank you today for victory and grace us to be able to focus on the cross, in true victory and peace today, in Jesus' mighty name. Amen and amen.]]></content:encoded>
